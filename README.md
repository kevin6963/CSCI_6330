# CSCI_6330

This study discusses the use of parallel processing techniques for data pretreatment and modeling.
To accelerate data preprocessing, the popular Python module MPI4Py is used. COVID-19 data is preprocessed with and without MPI for comparative analysis. We examine the outcomes of the two situations.


The procedure for running our code is as follows:

1. You can run each cell one at a time or all at once.

2. Navigate to kernel >> Restart the kernel and execute all

3. Before running, ensure that the necessary Python libraries have been imported.

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn (for MinMax scaling)
time (for checking CPU time)
