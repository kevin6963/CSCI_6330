# CSCI_6330

This project aims to improve the efficiency of data pretreatment and modeling by leveraging parallel processing techniques. To accomplish this, the popular Python module MPI4Py is used to expedite the data preprocessing stage. The project entails comparing COVID-19 data preprocessing with and without MPI, and the results from both situations are investigated.

You have two options for running the code:

You can run each cell separately.
You may also pick "Kernel" from the menu and then "Restart Kernel and Run All" to run all the cells at once.
Make sure the following Python libraries are imported before running the code:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn (for MinMax scaling)
time (for checking CPU time)
